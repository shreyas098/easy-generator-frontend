# React Frontend Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed (preferably version 14 or later).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
